C# model hidden dirty flag
A "hidden dirty flag" in a C# model refers to a boolean property or variable that is used to track whether the state of the model object has been modified. It is often used in conjunction with data binding or undo/redo functionality, to determine if changes need to be saved or if the previous state needs to be restored. The flag is typically "hidden" in the sense that it is not exposed as a public property and is only used internally within the model class.

Example of above
Here is an example of a simple C# model class that uses a "hidden dirty flag" to track changes:

Copy code
class MyModel
{
    private bool _isDirty = false;
    private string _name;

    public string Name
    {
        get { return _name; }
        set
        {
            if (_name != value)
            {
                _name = value;
                _isDirty = true;
            }
        }
    }

    public bool IsDirty
    {
        get { return _isDirty; }
        set { _isDirty = value; }
    }

    public void Save()
    {
        // Code to save the model to a database or file
        _isDirty = false;
    }
}
In this example, the MyModel class has a private boolean property _isDirty that is used to track whether the model's state has been modified. The Name property is a public property that is exposed to allow the name to be read or set. When the Name property is set, it checks whether the new value is different from the current value. If it is, the _name field is updated and the _isDirty flag is set to true. The Save method can be called to persist the model to a database or file, and when it is called, it sets the _isDirty flag back to false.

The public IsDirty property can be used to check whether the model has been modified or not. If a user modifies the Name property and calls the Save() method, the IsDirty property will return false

The above example is a simple one, it can be used in more complex situations where the model has multiple properties and you want to track the state of all of them.

More complex example
Here's an example of a more complex model class that uses a "hidden dirty flag" to track changes to multiple properties:

Copy code
class Person
{
    private bool _isDirty = false;
    private string _firstName;
    private string _lastName;
    private int _age;
    private string _address;
    private bool _isEmployed;

    public string FirstName
    {
        get { return _firstName; }
        set
        {
            if (_firstName != value)
            {
                _firstName = value;
                _isDirty = true;
            }
        }
    }

    public string LastName
    {
        get { return _lastName; }
        set
        {
            if (_lastName != value)
            {
                _lastName = value;
                _isDirty = true;
            }
        }
    }

    public int Age
    {
        get { return _age; }
        set
        {
            if (_age != value)
            {
                _age = value;
                _isDirty = true;
            }
        }
    }

    public string Address
    {
        get { return _address; }
        set
        {
            if (_address != value)
            {
                _address = value;
                _isDirty = true;
            }
        }
    }

    public bool IsEmployed
    {
        get { return _isEmployed; }
        set
        {
            if (_isEmployed != value)
            {
                _isEmployed = value;
                _isDirty = true;
            }
        }
    }

    public bool IsDirty
    {
        get { return _isDirty; }
        set { _isDirty = value; }
    }

    public void Save()
    {
        // Code to save the model to a database or file
        _isDirty = false;
    }

    public void Reset()
    {
        _isDirty = false;
        _firstName = "";
        _lastName = "";
        _age = 0;
        _address = "";
        _isEmployed = false;
    }
}
In this example, the Person class has multiple private fields: _firstName, _lastName, _age, _address, _isEmployed and a private boolean property _isDirty that is used to track whether the model's state has been modified.

Each of the public properties has a getter and setter that checks whether the new value is different from the current value. If it is, the corresponding private field is updated and the _isDirty flag is set to true.

The Save() method can be called to persist the model to a database or file and when it is called, it sets the _isDirty flag back to false.

The public IsDirty property can be used to check whether the model has been modified or not.

The Reset() method can be used to reset the model to it's default state and _isDirty flag to false.

In this example, the Person class has more properties than the previous example and it's using
