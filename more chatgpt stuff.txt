C# model bindinglist isdirty
The BindingList<T> class in C# is a generic implementation of the IBindingList interface, which provides a way to track changes to a list of items. The IsDirty property is not a built-in property of the BindingList<T> class, but it can be implemented as a custom property by subclassing the BindingList<T> class and adding the IsDirty property to the subclass. This property can be used to track whether the list has been modified and determine if the changes should be saved.

an example
Here's an example of a custom BindingList class that includes an IsDirty property:

Copy code
class MyBindingList<T> : BindingList<T>
{
    private bool _isDirty = false;

    public bool IsDirty
    {
        get { return _isDirty; }
    }

    protected override void OnListChanged(ListChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        _isDirty = true;
        base.OnListChanged(e);
    }
}
In this example, the custom MyBindingList<T> class is a subclass of BindingList<T> and it has an additional IsDirty property. The IsDirty property is a simple Boolean flag that can be used to determine if the list has been modified. The OnListChanged method is overridden to set the IsDirty flag to true whenever an item is added, removed, or modified in the list.

You can use this custom bindinglist like this:

Copy code
MyBindingList<MyType> myList = new MyBindingList<MyType>();
myList.Add(new MyType());
Console.WriteLine(myList.IsDirty); // prints 'True'

bulk update using entity framework core
In Entity Framework Core, you can use the UpdateRange method to update multiple entities in a single call. This method takes an IEnumerable of entities as an argument and updates their state in the database. Here's an example of how you might use it:

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var entities = context.MyEntities.Where(e => e.IsActive == true).ToList();
    entities.ForEach(e => e.IsActive = false);
    context.UpdateRange(entities);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
In this example, the Where method is used to filter the MyEntities collection and return only the entities where IsActive is true. The ToList method is used to retrieve the filtered entities from the database and load them into memory. The ForEach method is then used to update the IsActive property of each entity to false. Finally, the UpdateRange method is called to update the state of all of the entities in the database.

You can also use Update method to update a single entity

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var entity = context.MyEntities.FirstOrDefault(e => e.Id == 1);
    if (entity != null)
    {
        entity.Name = "New Name";
        context.Update(entity);
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
}
Please note that in order to use UpdateRange and Update method you have to enable ClientEval by calling UseClientEvaluation() on your dbcontext options.
Also, be aware that if the entities have some navigation properties, the behavior for the related entities might be different depending on the Cascade settings of the navigation properties and the SaveChanges method.

I hope this helps!

bulk update sql using entity framework core
In Entity Framework Core, you can use the ExecuteSqlInterpolated method to execute raw SQL statements to perform a bulk update. Here's an example of how you might use it:

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    string sql = "UPDATE MyEntities SET IsActive = 0 WHERE IsActive = 1";
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlInterpolated(sql);
}
In this example, the ExecuteSqlInterpolated method is used to execute a raw SQL statement that updates the IsActive property of all entities where IsActive is 1 to 0.

You can also use ExecuteSqlCommand method that takes in the SQL statement as a string and any additional parameters

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    string sql = "UPDATE MyEntities SET Name = {0} WHERE Id = {1}";
    context.Database.ExecuteSqlCommand(sql, "New Name", 1);
}
Please note that ExecuteSqlCommand and ExecuteSqlInterpolated methods are not part of the DbContext's change tracking mechanism and do not update the entities state in the context, so you have to manually refresh your entities, if you are going to use them after the update.

It's also important to note that when working with raw SQL statements, you're bypassing the benefits of using an ORM like EF, such as change tracking and automated protection against SQL injection attacks. It's advisable to use these methods only when you have to perform a complex query or update that can't be easily expressed using LINQ.

I hope this helps!

C# bulk sql server operations example
In C#, you can use the SqlBulkCopy class to perform bulk insert, update, and delete operations on a SQL Server database.

Here is an example of using the SqlBulkCopy class to perform a bulk insert operation:

Copy code
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();
    using (SqlBulkCopy bulkCopy = new SqlBulkCopy(connection))
    {
        bulkCopy.DestinationTableName = "dbo.MyTable";
        bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column1", "Column1");
        bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column2", "Column2");
        bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column3", "Column3");
        bulkCopy.WriteToServer(dataTable);
    }
}
In this example, a connection to the SQL Server database is established using the connectionString variable. The SqlBulkCopy class is used to copy data from a DataTable object called dataTable to a table called "dbo.MyTable" in the database. The ColumnMappings property is used to specify the mapping between the columns in the dataTable object and the columns in the target table. Finally, the WriteToServer method is called to perform the bulk insert operation.

You can also use SqlBulkCopy to perform an update, by specifying the SqlBulkCopyOptions.TableLock option, and matching the columns that you want to update, as well as the columns that you want to use as the filter.

Copy code
using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(connectionString))
{
    connection.Open();
    using (SqlBulkCopy bulkCopy = new SqlBulkCopy(connection, SqlBulkCopyOptions.TableLock))
    {
        bulkCopy.DestinationTableName = "dbo.MyTable";
        bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column1", "Column1");
        bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column2", "Column2");
        bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column3", "Column3");
        bulkCopy.WriteToServer(dataTable);
    }
}
Please note that the SqlBulkCopy class is a low-level class and it doesn't track changes or validate the data before it is inserted or updated. You need to ensure that the data is valid and consistent before using this class. Also, this class can't be used to delete data, you should use ExecuteSqlCommand or ExecuteSqlInterpolated for that.

I hope this helps!

bulkcopy entity framework
In Entity Framework (EF) Core, you can use the SqlBulkCopy class to perform bulk insert, update, and delete operations on a SQL Server database. However, you need to do it manually, as EF Core does not provide built-in support for the SqlBulkCopy class.

Here is an example of using the SqlBulkCopy class to perform a bulk insert operation:

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var entities = context.MyEntities.ToList();
    DataTable dataTable = new DataTable();
    // convert entities to a DataTable
    using (SqlConnection connection = new SqlConnection(context.Database.GetDbConnection().ConnectionString))
    {
        connection.Open();
        using (SqlBulkCopy bulkCopy = new SqlBulkCopy(connection))
        {
            bulkCopy.DestinationTableName = "dbo.MyTable";
            // map the DataTable columns to the target table columns
            bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column1", "Column1");
            bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column2", "Column2");
            bulkCopy.ColumnMappings.Add("Column3", "Column3");
            bulkCopy.WriteToServer(dataTable);
        }
    }
}
In this example, a connection to the SQL Server database is established using the connectionString variable. The SqlBulkCopy class is used to copy data from a DataTable object called dataTable to a table called "dbo.MyTable" in the database. The ColumnMappings property is used to specify the mapping between the columns in the dataTable object and the columns in the target table. Finally, the WriteToServer method is called to perform the bulk insert operation.

As you can see, you would need to convert entities to a DataTable, or retrieve the data from the database using a plain SQL query, and then perform the bulk insert using the SqlBulkCopy class.

As for updating, you can use SqlBulkCopy with the SqlBulkCopyOptions.TableLock option, and matching the columns that you want to update, as well as the columns that you want to use as the filter.

It's important to note that the SqlBulkCopy class is a low-level class and it doesn't track changes or validate the data before it is inserted or updated, so you need to ensure that the data is valid and consistent before using this class, also, as I said before, you would need to convert entities to DataTable, or retrieve the data using a plain SQL query.

Bindinlist save changes to sql
The BindingList<T> class in C# is a generic implementation of the IBindingList interface, which provides a way to track changes to a list of items. To save changes made to a BindingList<T> to a SQL Server database, you can use Entity Framework (EF) Core to persist the changes to the database.

Here is an example of how you might use EF Core to save changes made to a BindingList<T> to a SQL Server database:

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var myList = new BindingList<MyEntity>();
    context.MyEntities.AddRange(myList);
    context.SaveChanges();
}
In this example, a new instance of the MyDbContext class is created, which represents the database context. A new BindingList<MyEntity> is created and populated with items. The items in the BindingList<MyEntity> are added to the MyEntities DbSet, which maps to the corresponding table in the database. The SaveChanges method is then called to persist the changes to the database.

You can also use Add method to add a single item to the DBSet and then call SaveChanges to persist it to the database.

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var myList = new BindingList<MyEntity>();
    context.MyEntities.Add(myList.First());
    context.SaveChanges();
}
You can also use the UpdateRange method and RemoveRange method to update and delete multiple entities in a single call, respectively.

Please note that the BindingList<T> class is typically used for data binding in Windows Forms and WPF applications, and it's not an integral part of EF Core, so you have to map it to the entities and perform the save operation manually.

I hope this helps!

complex automapper list example
AutoMapper is a powerful library that can be used to map between objects of different types, including lists of objects. Here's an example of how you might use AutoMapper to map a list of complex objects:

Copy code
//Create mapping configuration
var config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg => {
    cfg.CreateMap<Source, Destination>()
       .ForMember(dest => dest.Property1, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.OtherProperty))
       .ForMember(dest => dest.Property2, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Child.ChildProperty))
       .ForMember(dest => dest.Property3, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Child.GrandChild.GrandChildProperty))
       .ForMember(dest => dest.Property4, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => src.Child.GrandChild.GreatGrandChild.GreatGrandChildProperty))
});

// Use the mapper
var mapper = config.CreateMapper();

// map a list of sources to a list of destinations
List<Source> sources = GetSources();
List<Destination> destinations = mapper.Map<List<Destination>>(sources);
In this example, the MapperConfiguration class is used to create a mapping configuration. The CreateMap method is used to create a map between the Source and Destination types. The ForMember method is used to specify the mapping between individual properties of the Source and Destination types.

In this example, it's showing how to map properties from a complex object graph: Child, GrandChild, GreatGrandChild.

Finally, the CreateMapper method is called to create an instance of the mapper, and the Map method is used to map a list of Source objects to a list of Destination objects.

Please note that for this example to work, you need to have AutoMapper installed in your project. You can install it via NuGet package manager by searching for "AutoMapper" and installing the package.

It's also important to note that AutoMapper requires that the source and destination types have matching property names and types for the mapping to work correctly. If the property names and types do not match, you will need to use the ForMember method to specify the mapping manually.

I hope this helps!

automapper convert enum
AutoMapper can be used to map between enum values when the source and destination types have different names or underlying types.

Here is an example of how you might use AutoMapper to map an enum value from a source type to a destination type:

Copy code
//Create mapping configuration
var config = new MapperConfiguration(cfg => {
    cfg.CreateMap<Source, Destination>()
       .ForMember(dest => dest.DestinationEnum, opt => opt.MapFrom(src => (DestinationEnum)src.SourceEnum))
});

// Use the mapper
var mapper = config.CreateMapper();

// map a source object to a destination object
Source source = new Source() {SourceEnum = SourceEnum.Value1};
Destination destination = mapper.Map<Destination>(source);
In this example, the MapperConfiguration class is used to create a mapping configuration. The CreateMap method is used to create a map between the Source and Destination types. The ForMember method is used to specify the mapping between the SourceEnum property of the Source type and the DestinationEnum property of the Destination type.

The MapFrom method is used to specify that the DestinationEnum property should be set to the value of the SourceEnum property, cast to the DestinationEnum type.

Please note that for this example to work, you need to have AutoMapper installed in your project. You can install it via NuGet package manager by searching for "AutoMapper" and installing the package.

You can also use the Enum type conversion feature from automapper by using cfg.CreateMap<SourceEnum, DestinationEnum>().ConvertUsing(src => (DestinationEnum) src);

Ed framework core multiple result sets stored procedure
In Entity Framework Core (EF Core), you can use the FromSqlInterpolated method to execute a stored procedure that returns multiple result sets, and map the results to multiple entities. Here's an example of how you might use it:

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var sql = "EXEC MyStoredProcedure @param1, @param2";
    var param1 = "value1";
    var param2 = 2;
    var results = context.Set<Entity1>()
                .FromSqlInterpolated(sql, param1, param2)
                .AsNoTracking()
                .ToList();

    var results2 = context.Set<Entity2>()
                .FromSqlInterpolated(sql, param1, param2)
                .AsNoTracking()
                .ToList();
}
In this example, the FromSqlInterpolated method is used to execute a stored procedure called MyStoredProcedure with two parameters param1 and param2. The results are mapped to the entities Entity1 and Entity2 respectively, and the AsNoTracking method is used to disable change tracking for the entities. The ToList method is used to materialize the results into a list.

You can also use FromSqlRaw method that takes in the SQL statement as a string and any additional parameters.

Please note that when you execute a stored procedure that returns multiple result sets, you have to use FromSqlInterpolated or FromSqlRaw method multiple times to retrieve each result set and map them to the corresponding entities.

It's also important to note that when working with raw SQL statements, you're bypassing the benefits of using an ORM like EF Core, such as change

Ef core stored procedure retunn and output parameters
In Entity Framework Core (EF Core), you can use the FromSqlInterpolated or FromSqlRaw method to execute a stored procedure that has both return value and output parameters. Here's an example of how you might use it:

Copy code
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var sql = "EXEC @returnValue = MyStoredProcedure @param1, @param2 OUTPUT";
    var param1 = "value1";
    var param2 = 2;
    var returnValue = new SqlParameter("@returnValue", SqlDbType.Int)
    {
        Direction = ParameterDirection.ReturnValue
    };
    var outputParam = new SqlParameter("@param2", SqlDbType.Int)
    {
        Direction = ParameterDirection.Output
    };

    var results = context.Set<Entity>().FromSqlInterpolated(sql, param1, outputParam, returnValue).ToList();

    var retunValue = returnValue.Value;
    var outputValue = outputParam.Value;
}
In this example, the FromSqlInterpolated method is used to execute a stored procedure called MyStoredProcedure with two parameters param1 and param2. param1 is passed as input parameter and param2 is passed as output parameter. returnValue is passed as return value.

You can also use FromSqlRaw method that takes in the SQL statement as a string and any additional parameters.

You need to create SqlParameter objects for the return value and output parameters, and set their Direction property to ParameterDirection.ReturnValue or ParameterDirection.Output respectively.

c# bindinglist with isdirty model example
The BindingList<T> class in C# is a generic implementation of the IBindingList interface, which provides a way to track changes to a list of items. To track the changes made to a BindingList<T> you can create a custom class that implements the INotifyPropertyChanged interface and use it as the type of the items in the BindingList<T>

Here is an example of how you might use a custom class to track changes made to a BindingList<T>:

Copy code
public class MyModel : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
    private bool _isDirty;
    public bool IsDirty
    {
        get { return _isDirty; }
        set
        {
            _isDirty = value;
            OnPropertyChanged();
        }
    }

    public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;

    protected void OnPropertyChanged([CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null)
    {
        PropertyChanged?.Invoke(this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs(propertyName));
    }
}
Copy code
public class MyViewModel
{
    private BindingList<MyModel> _models;
    public BindingList<MyModel> Models
    {
        get { return _models; }
        set
        {
            _models = value;
            _models.ListChanged += Models_ListChanged;
        }
    }

    private void Models_ListChanged(object sender, ListChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        if(e.ListChangedType



crowe.will@protonmail.com
Finish above code
== ListChangedType.ItemChanged)
{
Models[e.NewIndex].IsDirty = true;
}
}

Copy code
public void SaveChanges()
{
    using (var context = new MyDbContext())
    {
        var dirtyModels = Models.Where(m => m.IsDirty).ToList();
        context.MyEntities.UpdateRange(dirtyModels);
        context.SaveChanges();
    }
}
}

Copy code

In this example, a custom class called `MyModel` is defined that implements the `INotifyPropertyChanged` interface. This class has a property `IsDirty` which is used to track if the model has been modified.

A ViewModel class `MyViewModel` is defined, which contains a `BindingList<MyModel>` property called `Models`. The `ListChanged` event is subscribed to on the `Models` property. In the event handler, when an item in the list is changed, the `IsDirty` property of that item is set to `true`.

In the `SaveChanges` method, the dirty models are retrieved from the list and passed to the `UpdateRange` method of the DbSet. Then the `SaveChanges` method of the DbContext is called to persist the changes to the database.

It's important to note that in this example, the `SaveChanges` method only updates the dirty models, and you would need to add additional code to handle adding and deleting models. 

Also, it's important to note that this is a simple example for demonstration purposes only, in a real-world scenario you would need to handle things like concurrency, validation, and error handling.

I hope this helps!

Show example of adding and deleting models
Here is an example of how you might add and delete items from a BindingList<T> using a custom class:

Copy code
public class MyViewModel
{
    private BindingList<MyModel> _models;
    public BindingList<MyModel> Models
    {
        get { return _models; }
        set
        {
            _models = value;
            _models.ListChanged += Models_ListChanged;
        }
    }

    private void Models_ListChanged(object sender, ListChangedEventArgs e)
    {
        if(e.ListChangedType == ListChangedType.ItemChanged)
        {
            Models[e.NewIndex].IsDirty = true;
        }
        else if(e.ListChangedType == ListChangedType.ItemAdded)
        {
            Models[e.NewIndex].IsDirty = true;
        }
    }

    public void AddModel(MyModel model)
    {
        Models.Add(model);
    }

    public void DeleteModel(MyModel model)
    {
        Models.Remove(model);
    }

    public void SaveChanges()
    {
        using (var context = new MyDbContext())
        {
            var dirtyModels = Models.Where(m => m.IsDirty).ToList();
            var newModels = dirtyModels.Where(m => m.Id == 0).ToList();
            var updatedModels = dirtyModels.Where(m => m.Id != 0).ToList();
            var deletedModels = Models.Where(m => !dirtyModels.Contains(m)).ToList();

            context.MyEntities.AddRange(newModels);
            context.MyEntities.UpdateRange(updatedModels);
            context.MyEntities.RemoveRange(deletedModels);
            context.SaveChanges();
        }
    }
}
In this example, the MyViewModel class has been updated to include methods to add and delete items from the BindingList<MyModel>. The AddModel method takes a MyModel object as a parameter and adds it to the BindingList<MyModel>. The DeleteModel method takes a MyModel object as a parameter and removes it from the BindingList<MyModel>.

In the SaveChanges method, the dirty models are retrieved from the list and separated into three groups: new models, updated models, and deleted models. The AddRange, UpdateRange, and RemoveRange methods of the DbSet are used to add new models, update existing models, and delete models that were removed from the BindingList<MyModel>. The SaveChanges method of the DbContext is then called to persist the changes to the database.

It's important to note that, in this example, the SaveChanges method also updates the dirty models, and you would need to add additional code to handle adding and deleting models. Also, it's important to note that this is a simple example for demonstration purposes only, in a real-world scenario you would need to handle things like concurrency, validation, and error handling.

Awesome job, how would I sort the list above
You can use the OrderBy and ThenBy extension methods from Linq to sort the list of items in a BindingList<T>. Here's an example of how you might sort the list by multiple properties:

Copy code
public class MyViewModel
{
    private BindingList<MyModel> _models;
    public BindingList<MyModel> Models
    {
        get { return _models; }
        set
        {
            _models = value;
            _models.ListChanged += Models_ListChanged;
        }
    }

    public void SortByProperty1()
    {
        var sortedModels = Models.OrderBy(m => m.Property1).ToList();
        Models = new BindingList<MyModel>(sortedModels);
    }

    public void SortByProperty2()
    {
        var sortedModels = Models.OrderBy(m => m.Property2).ThenBy(m => m.Property1).ToList();
        Models = new BindingList<MyModel>(sortedModels);
    }
}
In this example, the SortByProperty1 method sorts the list by the Property1 property of the MyModel class. The SortByProperty2 method sorts the list first by the Property2 property and then by the Property1 property.

It's important to note that in this example I'm creating a new instance of BindingList<MyModel> after sorting, this is because the BindingList<T> doesn't have a built-in sorting method.

You can use the OrderBy and ThenBy methods to sort the list by any property of the MyModel class that you want, you can also use OrderByDescending and ThenByDescending to sort the list in descending order.

It's also important to note that this is a simple example for demonstration purposes only, in a real-world scenario you would need to handle things like UI notifications about sorting and error handling.

I hope this helps!
